# SubliminalsTV's Curated Joystick Bindings

This is the start of making my bindings open source so I can leverage the power of the Star Citizen Community to be able to release bindings faster and for more joysticks and joystick combinations.

## Who this repository is for?

+ Users who have a pretty good understanding of how Joystick Gremlin works
+ Users who have a decent understanding of how to load profiles into Star Citizen
+ Anyone in the Star Citizen community regardless of expertise who would like to test and give feedback on the most recent binds.

## Who this repository IS NOT for

+ Users who want to load the most stable Joystick Gremlin, and Star Citizen binding profiles. And forgo the initial release issues.

If you are the latter please head over to the [bindings](https://subliminal.gg/bindings/) section of my website for the latest stable releases.
